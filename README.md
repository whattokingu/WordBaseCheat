# WordBaseCheat
A runnable jar to help you find words in the mobile game, Word Base.

You have to convert the game board into a txt file similar to some of those in the repo. (See boardp.txt, for example)

To run the jar, open up terminal (for Mac). I am sorry. I am not sure what is the equivalent in Windows.
navigate to the directory where the jar file resides, and type
  ```
  java -jar wordbasecheat.jar
  ```

When the jar runs, it will prompt you for you gameboard file name. 
It has to be in the same directory as the jar file.
You can type, for example:
  ```
  boardp
  ```
Then enter the index of the square to take as root, i.e, the 1st letter of the word. 

It returns a list of up words, each up to 10 letters, that starts with the root letter. 

The cycle repeats.

Enjoy!
